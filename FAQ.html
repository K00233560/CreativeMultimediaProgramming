                        <h2>Q1. What types of jobs will this course prepare me for?
                        </h2>
                        <p>As can be seen in the Modules section, this course covers a wide variety of subjects in a short amount of time. This gives students a taster of the variety of roles that are available within the multimedia industry. 
                        <br>
                        Some examples of jobs you will be able to apply for on completion of the course include: 
                        </p>
                       <ol class="jobs">
                            <li>Interaction Designer</li>
                            <li>UX / UI Designer</li>
                            <li>Front End Web Developer</li>
                            <li>Back End Developer</li>
                            <li>Web QA Tester</li>

                        <h2>Q2. I enjoy being creative but have no background in design or IT, will I be able for this course?
                        </h2>
                          <p>While it would be helpful to have some experience either with programming, or using design software such as Adobe Photoshop / Illustrator / Premiere Pro, it is not necessary. A mix of people with all backgrounds complete this course - some have coding experience, some have a creative/ design background, and some have no experience at all. I myself had no experience in either before starting this course. I could just about do the basics on a computer before I started the course! However as I always wanted to do something more creative, the more we covered on the course, the more I wanted to learn. And here I am nearly at the end of the course - if I can do it, anyone can! :)   
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h2>Q3. What is the timetable like for this course? 
                        </h2>
                          <p>
                              This is an intense, full time course that involves alot of contact hours. Semester 1 requires up to 27 hours in class (and that's before projects and assignments) and while there are less contact hours in semester 2 (11-13 hours), the projects are larger and require a lot of time to complete. Placement for the summer must also be secured during semester 2.  
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h2>Q4. Will I be able to continue working full time if I start this course?
                        </h2>
                          <p>
                              With so much new content and regular deadlines, in my opinion I think it would be extremely difficult to maintain a full time job, and also keep up to date with all the content on this course. If a person has no other option but to work while studying, they might be able to keep a part-time job. However, it depends on the individual and the type of job they work in.
