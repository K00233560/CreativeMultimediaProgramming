                    <p>
                            Interaction design is a process in which designers focus on creating engaging web interfaces with logical and thought out behaviors and actions. Successful interactive design uses technology and principles of good communication to create desired user experiences.
                            Interaction designers strive to create meaningful relationships between people and the products and services that they use, from computers to mobile devices to appliances and beyond. <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/complete-beginners-guide-to-interaction-design/">Source</a>.
